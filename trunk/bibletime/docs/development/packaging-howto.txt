This is a small explanation how to create packages of BibleTime
---------------------------------------------------------------

-Source packages of BibleTime:
------------------------------
	Builidng source packages is only required after a new release and not necessary for users.
	To build source packages like bibletime-1.5.tar.bz2 execute these commands and procedures:
	
	1. Change in configure.in.in the version number to the right one. 
		Check README.in and INSTALL.in if the requirements and their version numbers changed.	
	
	2. "./autogen.sh && ./configure && make distclean && rm
bibletime-*.tar*" to cleanup the source directory
	
	3. "make dist" to create the package bibletime-1.5.tar.bz2
	
	4. Test the package. Execute "tar -xjf bibletime-1.5.tar.bz2"
somewhere, then "cd bibletime-1.5" and then "./configure && make && make
install". Start BibleTime to test if the installation was successful and if all
icons etc. are present.
	
	4. Upload the bibletime-1.5.tar.bz2 file.


-Binary RPM of BibleTime
------------------------
	1. Locate where your RPM base directory is. On SuSE this is
/usr/src/packages. We continue with this dir.
	
	2. "cp bibletime-1.5.tar.bz2 /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/"
	
	3. "cp bibletime/bibletime.spec /usr/src/packages/SPECS/"
	
	4. "cd /usr/src/packages/"
	
	5. "rpm -ba SPECS/bibletime.spec". If this works you're on the good
side, otherwise it's not so good ;) Before you exec the rpm command make
sure you have a standard configuration, for example special graphic card
drivers will lead to wrong dependencies (e.g. NVidia drivers). Deinstall
them first if there are some, then build and then reinstall them.
	Also make sure you installed the x11-devel, qt3-devel and kdelibs-devel packages.
	
	6. Test the binary RPM. The binary package is normally located in
/usr/src/packages/RPMS/<arch>/, source RPMs are in /usr/src/packages/SRPMS/.
Often <arch> is "i586". Try to install the binary package by "rpm -U
bibletime-1.5-1.rpm" and check dependencies by executing "rpm -q --requires
bibletime".
	
	7. Rename the RPM to have the right name, including the distribution
it was built on, e.g. "bibletime-1.5-1.i586.rpm" should be renamed to
"bibletime-1.5-suse9.2-1.i586.rpm" so users know what distribution this package was built for.
	
	8. Release the binary and source package. The source package should
have it's original name because it's distribution independant.
