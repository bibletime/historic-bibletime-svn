Bookshelf. Drop it on the work you want to open, and it will be opened for reading at the specified location.

You can search in a work by clicking with the <span class="mousebutton">right</span>

Click with the <span class="mousebutton">right</span> mouse button on the bookmark category of the bookshelf and select <span class="guimenuitem">"Create new folder"</span> to create a new bookmark subfolder. You can use normal drag &amp; drop
functions to drag verse references from read windows or search results to the bookmark folder, and to rearrange bookmarks between folders.</p><p>You can also import bookmarks from other people or export bookmarks to share them. To do this, open the <span class="guimenu">context menu</span> of the bookmark folder as described above, and select <span class="guimenuitem">"Export bookmarks"</span>. This will bring up a dialog box for you to save the bookmark collection. You can import bookmarks in a similar way.</p><p>You can also click with the <span class="mousebutton">right</span> on folders and bookmarks to change their names and descriptions.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="hdbk-op-parts-mag"></a>The Mag(nifying glass)</h3></div></div></div><p>This little window in the lower left corner of the <span class="application">BibleTime</span> window is purely passive. Whenever your mouse cursor is located over some text with additional information (e.g., Strong's numbers), then this additional information will be displayed in the Mag, and not in the text itself. Just try it out.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="hdbk-op-parts-desk"></a>The Desk</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Desk is where the real work with <span class="application">BibleTime</span> takes place. Here you can open works from the Bookshelf, read them, <a href="hdbk-op-search.html" title="Searching in works">search</a> in them, and even save your annotations in the personal commentary module (see <a href="hdbk-op-parts.html#hdbk-op-parts-desk-write" title="Editing your own commentary">below</a>).</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="hdbk-op-parts-desk-read"></a>Reading works</h4></div></div></div><p>
As we have <a href="hdbk-op-parts.html#hdbk-op-parts-bookshelf-open" title="Reading works">already seen</a>, you can open works for reading simply by clicking on their symbol in the Bookshelf. A read window will open in the Desk's area. Every read window has a toolbar. There you can find tools to navigate in the work that this read window is connected to, as well as history buttons like the ones that you know from your browser.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="hdbk-op-parts-desk-placement"></a>Read window placement</h4></div></div></div><p>
Of course, you can open multiple works at the same time. There are several possibilities for arranging the read windows on the desk. Please have a look at the entry <span class="guimenu">Window</span> in the main menu. There you can see that you can either control the placement of the read windows completely yourself, or have <span class="application">BibleTime</span> handle the placement automatically. To achieve this, you have to select one of the automatic placement modes available at <span class="guimenu">Window</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Arrangement mode</span>. Just try it out, it's simple and works.

To be able to store your own comments about parts of the Bible, you have install a certain work from the library of the <a href="http://www.crosswire.org" target="_top">Crosswire Bible Society</a>. This work is called "Personal commentary".</p><p>
If you open the personal commentary by clicking on its symbol in the Bookshelf with a <span class="mousebutton">left</span> mouse button, it opens
in read mode. You will not be able to edit it in this mode. Should you wish to write annotations into the personal commentary, you have to open it with the <span class="mousebutton">right</span> mouse button and then select <span class="guimenu">Edit this work</span> and then either <span class="guimenuitem">Plain text</span>(source code editor) or <span class="guimenuitem">HTML</span>(basic gui wysiwyg editor).</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>If <span class="guimenu">Edit this work</span>
