more.  It doesn't seem to fit with what goes before and after!  This should tip us off that we aren't
understanding it rightly!!</p><p>What we have here is a Hebrew idiom,  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">evil eye</span>&#8221;</span>.  Let's look up other uses of this idiom: Mt.20:15
"<span class="emphasis"><em>Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own?  Or is your eye envious [lit."evil"] because I
am generous [lit. "good"]?</em></span>"  We find that having an "evil eye" is a Hebrew idiom for being stingy or envious.
Now go back to Mt.6 and notice how this understanding ties in so perfectly to the context.</p></div><div class="section" title="Example 4B"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="h2-rules-normal-ex4b"></a>Example 4B</h3></div></div></div><p>Is.59:1 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">The Lord's hand is not short;</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>Deut.33:27 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Underneath are the everlasting arms.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>
References to body parts of God are used by Latter-Day Saints to prove that God was once a man just as we
are.  Once they convince people of that, they go on to teach that we can become God just like He is!  At a
lecture he was giving, a group of Mormon elders challenged Walter Martin (author of <span class="emphasis"><em>Kingdom of the Cults</em></span>)
with an enumeration of verses like these.  Dr. Martin then asked the Mormons to read one more scripture:
Ps.91:4  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">He will cover you with His feathers; And under His wings shalt thou trust</span>&#8221;</span>.  W.M. said, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">By the same
rules of interpretation that you just proved God to be a man, you just proved that He is a bird</span>&#8221;</span>.  The Mormons
had to laugh as they realised the ridiculousness of their position.
