God, the thorns are worries and greed, etc.  But most parables are not allegories but simply stories to illustrate one
point.    It's dangerous to get our doctrine from parables; they can be twisted to say all sorts of things.  We need to get
our doctrine from clear scriptures that lay it out; then if a parable illustrates that, fine.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="h2-rules-parables-ex5a"></a>Example 5A</h3></div></div></div><p>The parable of the widow with the unrighteous judge in Lk.18:1-8. This story illustrates one
lesson:  boldness in prayer.  If we draw it into an allegory, what do we have?</p><p>All sorts of violence happens to the meanings: God is reluctant to protect the rights of widows, prayer
"bothers" Him, etc.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="h2-rules-parables-ex5b"></a>Example 5B</h3></div></div></div><p>The parable of the unrighteous steward in Lk.16:1-9.   What is the point of the parable?  Is it
an allegory? </p><p>The steward is commended for only one thing, his shrewdness in using what he had to prepare for a
time when he wouldn't have it.  But he is not commended for his unethical behavior in cheating his master. </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="h2-rules-normal.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="h2-rules.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> </td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Rule 4 - Interpret according to the normal usage of words in language </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
