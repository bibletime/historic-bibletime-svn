granted that behind them all was a single divine Author.  He could equally say
'Moses said' or 'God said' (Mk.7:10). He could quote a comment of the narrator in
Genesis 2:24 as an utterance of the Creator Himself (Mt.19:4-5).  Similarly He
said, 'Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written', when what He
went on to quote is the direct speech of the Lord God (Mk.7:6 &amp; Is.29:13).  It
is from Jesus Himself that the New Testament authors have gained their

say that 'God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets' (Heb.1:1) as it was to
say that 'men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God' (2 Pe.1:21).  God did not
speak in such a way as to obliterate the personality of the human authors, nor
