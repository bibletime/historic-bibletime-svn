	* Makefile: more realclean targets

2005-04-08  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: ignore .rng files

	* Makefile: make *.rng as well as *.rnc files (*.rng files are needed for
	people who want to do validation using xmllint)

2005-04-07  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: make -> $(MAKE)

	* schemas.xml: moved RELAX NG locating-rules file to root dir of distro, at same
	level as catalogs.xml, which has a similar purpose

2005-04-06  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* schemas.xml: New file.

2005-04-04  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: ignore stuff

	* Makefile: runtrang, fail if not found

2005-04-01  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: .rng files, don't generate (if you need them, use trang to
	generate them from the .rnc files); website-custom.rnc, don't
	generate (duh); clean target, be explicit about what files to
	remove

2005-03-31  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore, Makefile, autolayout.rng, extensions.rng, forms.rng, layout.rng, rddl.rng, union.xml, website-full.rng, website.rng: 
	build switched to generate all RNG schemas from DTDs; now also
	generates RNC versions from RNGs (you can use the RNCs for
	context-sensitive, validated editing in Emacs/nXML mode, Oxygen
	XML Editor, etc.); RNG and RNC conversions both rely on "trang";
	tagged the directory (tag name: "original") before making the
	change, so original CVS-maintained RNG files and union.xml and
	Makefile that were in this directory can be checked out at any
	time by doing a "cvs update -r original"

2003-06-22  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autolayout.rng, extensions.rng, layout.rng: Cleanup attributes on script element

	* autolayout.rng, layout.rng, website-full.rng, website.rng: 
	Updated version numbers

2003-02-18  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autolayout.rng, extensions.rng, forms.rng, layout.rng, rddl.rng, website-full.rng, website.rng: 
	Updated version numbers to 2.4.1

2003-01-23  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore websitedb.rng

	* .cvsignore, Makefile: Updated

	* config.xml: Generated

	* config.xml, union.xml: Changed configuration strategy

	* extensions.rng, forms.rng, rddl.rng, website-full.rng, website.rng: 
	Removed extraneous xmlns declaration

	* union.xml: Oops. I did need this file

	* websitedb.rng: This file is generated

2003-01-16  Norman Walsh <nwalsh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore, Makefile, autolayout.rng, extensions.rng, forms.rng, layout.rng, rddl.rng, union.xml, website-full.rng, website.rng, websitedb.rng: 
	New file.
