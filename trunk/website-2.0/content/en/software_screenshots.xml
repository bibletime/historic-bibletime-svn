      <para>Here you can see a typical BibleTime session.  On the left
	pane, you see the "bookshelf" which offers quick access to all
	installed electronic works as well as facilities to create and
	manage your own bookmarks.  Below is the "mag(nifying glass)",
	which can display additional information about a word or piece of
	text.  In this example it shows a cross reference, with
	scripture to Psalms 10:6.  The main part of the BibleTime
	window (called "desk") offers space to read works such as Bibles,
	commentaries, lexicons or other books.</para>

      <para>BibleTime offers a dialog to automatically download and
      manage electronic works. You simply define a library (a remote
      collection of works, such as 
      <ulink url="http://www.crosswire.org/sword/">Crosswire</ulink>),
      and then you can transfer works from this library to your local
      bookshelf to use them. Easy, huh?</para>
