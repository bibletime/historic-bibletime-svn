    <title>The history of BibleTime</title>

    <para>Back in June of 1999 Thomas Hagedorn, Thorsten Uhlmann and
      Joachim Ansorg started to work on a Bible study application for KDE
      1.0.</para>

    <para>The first version was released two months later as version
      0.1. This version was very simple and supported only the most basic
      things.</para>

    <para>After three months of hard work version 0.2 was released to
      the public. This version was usable, it supported basic printing,
      searching and offered a simple editor for personal notes.</para>

    <para>BibleTime 0.2 was later ported to KDE 2 and totally
      redesigned with a more powerful interface, better printing and a
      lot of internal changes. This version was called BibleTime
      0.3</para>

    <para>BibleTime 1.0, which was released almost one year after
      version 0.3 and was the first version we considered as
      stable.</para>

    <para>BibleTime 1.1 and 1.2 followed later on. BibleTime 1.2 is the
      first version of BibleTime for version 3.0 of KDE.</para>

    <para>BibleTime version 1.5 was released in July 2005 after a long
      time of development.</para>

    <para>BibleTime version 1.6 was released in September 2006, and
      utilized 
      <ulink url="http://clucene.sourceforge.net">CLucene</ulink> as its
      search engine.</para>

    <para>BibleTime version 1.7 was released in January 2008, it is the
      first version developed with Qt4 for use with KDE4.</para>

    <para>BibleTime version 2.0 was released in May 2009, developed
      with Qt4.  This transitions BibleTime to be be made available on
      other platforms in the future.</para>

    <para>In October 2009, the BibleTime Team hosted it's first ever 
      <ulink url="http://devel.bibletime.info/wiki/Bug-a-thon">Bug-a-thon</ulink>,
      bringing together developers, contributors and userbase to work on
      improving the BibleTime application.</para>
