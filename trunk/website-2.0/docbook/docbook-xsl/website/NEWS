  | 
  | 	* .cvsignore: ignore .urilist
  | 
  | 	* INSTALL: include instructions on how to use install.sh
  | 
  | 	* Makefile: more realclean stuff
  | 
  | 	* RELEASE-NOTES.xml: info about install.sh added
  | 
  | 	* VERSION: Version 2.6.0 released.
  | 
  | 	* locatingrules.xml: fix paths in comments
  | 
  | 2005-04-16  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

  | 
  | 2005-04-15  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* Makefile: URILIST format is now pairs of paths and URIs
  | 
  | 	* Makefile: added EXECUTABLES variable and added install.sh to
  | 	  its value
  | 
  | 	* catalog, catalog.xml: enable users to have "current" in
  | 	  schema URIs in doc instances;
  |
  |       http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/website/current/schema/
  |
  | 	  Yeah, I know that it's traditionally been the case that DocBook doc
  | 	  instances contain public and system IDs for a specific version of the
  | 	  DocBook DTD. But note that: - all versions of DocBook 4 are
  | 	  backward-compatible - doc instances don't actually need to contain any
  | 	  system or public ID at all users employ RELAX NG-based tools - for
  | 	  RELAX NG-based toolchain, users will probably be authoring and
  | 	  validating their doc instances against whatever is the current version
  | 	  of the RELAX NG schema for DocBook that that they have installed So
  | 	  enabling users to put "current" in their doc instances instead of a
  | 	  specific version number means that they don't need to update the URIs
  | 	  if/when they want to author/validate using a future version of the
  | 	  DTD.
  | 
  | 2005-04-14  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

  | 
  | 	* Makefile: more realclean targets
  | 
  | 2005-04-08  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* .cvsignore: ignore .rng files
  | 
  | 	* Makefile: make *.rng as well as *.rnc files (*.rng files are
  | 	  needed for people who want to do validation using xmllint)
  | 
  | 2005-04-07  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* Makefile: make -> $(MAKE)

  | 
  | 2005-04-06  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

  | 	  trang to generate them from the .rnc files);
  | 	  website-custom.rnc, don't generate (duh); clean target, be
  | 	  explicit about what files to remove
  | 
  | 2005-03-31  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* .cvsignore, Makefile, autolayout.rng, extensions.rng,
  | 	  forms.rng, layout.rng, rddl.rng, union.xml,
  | 	  website-full.rng, website.rng: build switched to generate
  | 	  all RNG schemas from DTDs; now also generates RNC versions
  | 	  from RNGs (you can use the RNCs for context-sensitive,
  | 	  validated editing in Emacs/nXML mode, Oxygen XML Editor,
  | 	  etc.); RNG and RNC conversions both rely on "trang"; tagged
  | 	  the directory (tag name: "original") before making the
  | 	  change, so original CVS-maintained RNG files and union.xml
  | 	  and Makefile that were in this directory can be checked out
  | 	  at any time by doing a "cvs update -r original"
  |
