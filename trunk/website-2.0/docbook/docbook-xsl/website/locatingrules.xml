<!-- This is a schema-locating file for use with a RELAX NG-aware editor -->
<!-- such as Emacs/nXML mode. It tells your editor to automatically -->
<!-- associate any documents whose root element is "webpage" (that is -->
<!-- DocBook Website documents), with the RNC schema file at the URI -->
<!-- "schema/relaxng/website.rnc". -->

<locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
  <documentElement prefix="" localName="webpage" uri="schema/relaxng/website.rnc"/>
<!--   <documentElement prefix="" localName="webpage" uri="schema/relaxng/website-full.rnc"/> -->
</locatingRules>

<!-- To use this file with Emacs/nXML mode, either: -->

<!-- - do M-x customize-variable rng-schema-locating-files -->
<!--   and then add the absolute path to this file there -->

<!--   OR -->

<!-- - put the following into your .emacs file: -->

<!--     (setq rng-schema-locating-files -->
<!--       (append -->
<!--         '("~/docbook-website/locatingrules.xml"))) -->

<!--   Of course, replace the ~/docbook-website/locatingrules.xml -->
<!--   pathname with the appropriate location for your system. -->
