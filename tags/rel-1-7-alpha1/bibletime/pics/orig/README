Crystal-like icons for Bibletime.

I used sodipodi to create these icons, and gimp to touch them up (crop and resize).

The icons are supposed to fit into Everaldo's Crystal icon theme nicely.

I've used different colours for the different types of book icons, to
make them more obvious when the icons are small.

In the preferences dialog, the icon for the colours page should be the standard
'colorize' icon which is in both kdeclassic and crystal. The bt_displayconfig icon
should be used in on the toolbar where it is currently used.

I've made 16, 22, 32 and 48 pixel versions of everything, but only
an app icon at the 64 pixel size.
