				Here you can see a typical BibleTime session. On the
				left pane, you see the "bookshelf" which offers quick
				access to all installed electronic works as well as
				facilities to create and manage your own bookmarks.
				Below is the "mag(nifying glass)", which can display
				additional information about a word or piece of text. In
				this example it shows details about the greek word that
				the KJV translates as "God". The main part of the
				BibleTime window (called "desk") offers space to read
				works such as Bibles, commentaries, lexicons or other
				books. The
				<ulink url="software_gallery.html">gallery</ulink>
				has some nice examples of BibleTime's powerful language
				handling capabilities.

				BibleTime offers a dialog to automatically download and
				manage electronic works. You simply define a library (a
				remote collection of works, such as
				<ulink url="http://www.crosswire.org/sword/">
					Crosswire
				</ulink>
				), and then you can transfer works from this library to
				your local bookshelf to use them. Easy, huh?

				BibleTime offers a powerful search dialog. You can
				choose between different search algorithms (from simple
				AND to regular expressions), and even limit your search
				to certain kinds of text, such as footnotes.
